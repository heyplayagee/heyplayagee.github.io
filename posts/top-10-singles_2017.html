      </b></h1>

    <hr>

    <p class="lead">From a year in which three very different songs (“Shape of You,” “Despacito,” and “Rockstar”) controlled the #1 spot in Billboard’s Hot 100 for a combined effort of 36 weeks a.k.a. 69% of the year (<em>DAYUM</em> GG y’all), one could suppose that there was a lack of solid tracks this year. And there kind of was… But there were also a bunch of fun tracks (and songs that weren’t included in this list) that made 2017 still an okay year.</p>

    <p class="lead">Note: The songs chosen are not necessarily my favorites of 2017, rather they affected me this year in some way.</p>

    <h2>Honorable Mentions</h2>
    <h3><b>“Feel It Still” by Portugal. The Man</b></h3>
    <p>One-hit wonder of the year: “Feel It Still” was one of the most pervasive songs of the year. Why? It was in so many dang commercials.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR5ODc5Wbbo">Apple</a>. Good job, that’s a big gig.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak0qa4XfxtE">Vitamin Water</a>. Umm, that’s alright, it’s fun commercial and Aaron Paul’s cool (bitch).</li>
        <li><a href="https://youtu.be/7Pa_Weidt08?t=16s">Peter Rabbit</a> the movie…</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      OKAY, WE GET IT! IT’S A GENERIC NONSENSICAL SONG perfect for evoking the most <em>neutral</em> of emotions. Participation points for trying to send us on a 60s groovy train, but the execution was mediocre which made it the perfect song for commercials, even for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qediav063xQ">YouTube</a> itself. 
    </p>
    <div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ak0qa4XfxtE?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

    <br>

    <h3><b>“Sunset Lover” by Petit Biscuit</b></h3>
    <p>
      You know you’ve got a powerful song when you got me trying to sing gibberish vocal chops. Look up the word “chill” in an audiobook of the dictionary and this song will play in the background.
    </p>

    <div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wuCK-oiE3rM?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

    <p>
      I’m a huge proponent of meaningful lyrics, but this song is better without them. The guitar immediately sucks you in and keeps you in a state of timelessness. If the Photoshop effect Ethereal Glow were personified in a song, “Sunset Lover” would be it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only reason this song is an honorable mention (it would’ve been #5 on my list) is because it is technically a 2016 song (the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6qf9cfaZJIB5pC5gygDr1o">10 million different mixes</a> released in 2017 shouldn’t count). Originally released in France in 2014/2015, “Sunset Lover” was re-released in its 2016 EP and it got added to every Chill Hits/Chill Vibes/Chill Nation/Chill Chill playlist on Spotify in 2017. No wonder it played at every transplant SF party I attended.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2><b>Top 10 Countdown</b></h2>
    <h3><b>Number 10: “Doves in the Wind” by SZA ft. Kendrick Lamar</b></h3>
    <div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ydmNO1go0mw?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

    <p>
      SZA had a good year! She is the most nominated woman at the Grammys this year with 5 noms. I chose “Doves in the Wind” because it encapsulates the feel of her entire debut album, <cite>Ctrl</cite>, consisting of a relaxed beat juxtaposed with the ardent sentiments for whatever topic she chooses. “Doves in the Wind” is dedicated to women and their pussies, which she and Lamar do not stray from repeating throughout the song.
    </p>

    <p>
      <cite>
        Forrest Gump had a lot goin' for him <br>
        Never without pussy <br>
        Y'know, Jenny almost gave it all up for him <br>
        Never even pushed for the pussy
      </cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      She’s referencing Forrest Gump in the entire first verse and that’s awesome! Life is like a box of chocolates and SZA makes sure you eat ALL the chocolates; you can’t just pick and choose and throw away the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      SZA and Lamar are so in sync in this song, the flow is like they do dynamic duo duets on the daily. I hope they collaborate on many more hits together.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Number 9: “Slide” by Calvin Harris ft. Frank Ocean & Migos</h3>
    <div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Ee4QjCEHHc?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

    <p>
      Frank Ocean’s voice is as smooth as ever, <em>sliding</em> us through the first half of the song questioning someone who <em>slides</em> into multiple DMs. If you couldn’t tell from my uses of the word “slide,” “Slide” is an appropriate and versatile title.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quavo and Offset both add in their signature flows, finishing off with all three artists harmonizing in the chorus. The blend of all three of their voices is effortless and just works really well to complete the vibe.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3><b>Number 8: “Winter Workout Plan” by Felix Snow ft. Wintertime</b></h3>
    Remember VH1’s You Oughta Know segment with up and coming artists? Felix Snow is a very under-the-radar name, but you’ve probably heard one of his productions. He’s also part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEHj_OyKY1Y">Terror Jr.</a>, a strange sound I’m drawn to, so this song was my jam in January/February.

    <div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqOL-Lr6m4s?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

    <p>
      Why does this song even matter? It wasn’t a mainstream hit. It’s not even on an EP, it’s a mixtape. It doesn’t even have a Wikipedia page. When you Google “Winter Workout Plan” the top search results are actual exercise plans!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is just a feel good, chill song with a nice beat, which is what I want in the winter time! I don’t need prophetic lyrics, a complex story, or an incredibly dramatic harpsichord playing the background. My favorite lyrics are “She said, ‘You a youngin’, how you get in the club?’ Girl, as far as you know, I'm 21.” They’re just fun lyrics. And at that moment, I realized Wintertime was 20 when the song was released. Dang, I feel old.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3><b>Number 7: “That’s What I Like” by Bruno Mars</b></h3>
    <div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PMivT7MJ41M?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

    <p>
      Bruno Mars has the sleaziest lyrics, often trying too hard to seem like a player who has the ladies lining up to smell his shadow. Similar to “24K Magic,” the song is full of obnoxious, conceited lyrics, but it’s all in good fun: <br><br>
      <cite>
        Now tell me who's the fairest <br>
        Is it you? (is it you?) Is it me? (is it me?) <br>
        Say it's us (say it's us) and I'll agree, baby <br>
      </cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      I have so much respect for Mars’s musical creativity. “That’s What I Like” was easily 2017’s fun and refreshing song of the summer.

      <h3><b>Number 6: “Do re mi” by Blackbear</b></h3>
      <p>
        First listen, I thought the chorus sounded petty, but halfway through the song, I realized the chorus is on point. And that bass is bomb!
      </p>

      <div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dfzlUHOFQ5k?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

      <p>
        This song is sassy!<br><br>
        <cite>
          And you got me thinking lately <br>
          Bitch, you crazy <br>
          And nothing's ever good enough <br>
          I wrote a little song for ya, it go like... <br>
        </cite>
        <br>
        What is this, an angsty, male Taylor Swift? Haha. But it works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Best line is the one everyone sings along to: “Do re mi fa so fucking done with you girl” like DAMN that’s good. I haven’t sung “do re mi” in a song since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLm07s8fnzM"><cite>The Sound of Music</cite></a>. I was also in choir in middle and high school so I’ve been ingrained to respect a chorus full of satisfying solfege.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h3><b>Number 5: “Young Dumb & Broke” by Khalid</b></h3>
      <p>
        Khalid released this year’s anthem for a generation, relatable to high school kids, college students, up to adults in their thirties. Basically, millennials. I usually hate the term, but I’m not using it in a way to belittle an entire generation.
      </p>
      <div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IPfJnp1guPc?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
      <p>
        The song is so relevant to more than simply high schoolers as the song at the absolute surface describes. I think a lot of people in their 20s including myself can relate (woo!) and feel young, dumb, and broke (SF ain’t cheap and that’s coming from someone who lives at home). 
      </p>
      <p>
        The lyrics describe high school relationship: casual, temporary, and not really necessary and honestly that continues on through your 20s! Whether you’re a high-school kid or a high schoolkid, this is a fun song to simultaneously reminisce and relate to.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h3><b>Number 4: “Bodak Yellow” by Cardi B</b></h3>
      <p>
        Cardi B is the fierce female fire on the airwaves (and whatever waves wi-fi travels on) in 2017! Female rap songs with clever lyrics, charisma, and a strong, genuine execution on mainstream radio are hard to come by.
      </p>
      <div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PEGccV-NOm8?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

      <p>
        From Cardi B’s first line, she spits hot fire: “Said, ‘Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to.’”
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if <em>you</em> don’t like the song, people wanted to listen and it showed. She topped the Billboard Hot 100 and set the bar!
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>First artist of Dominican descent at #1 on the US charts <strong>EVER</strong>.</li>
          <li>Second solo female rap song (<strong>NO FEATURES NEEDED</strong>) to hit #1 since Lauryn Hill in 1998. That’s crazy it’s been so long!</li>
          <li>Longest time (3 weeks) a solo female rap song has been at #1!</li>
          <li>One of two songs by a woman to hit #1 in the <strong>ENTIRE</strong> year of 2017 and the <strong>ONLY</strong> woman of color to have a song hit #1 this year. It’s really sad that both of these facts are accomplishments, but what I’m saying is, Cardi B represented in a year that lacked mainstream representation.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>THIS WAS HER FIRST SINGLE.</strong> And she killed it!
        <br><br>
        <cite>
          I don't dance now, I make money moves <br>
          Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
        </cite>
      </p>

      <br>

      <h3><b>Number 3: “DNA.” by Kendrick Lamar</b></h3>
      <p>
        “DNA.” is one of my <strong>favorite</strong> tracks from Kendrick Lamar’s 2017 album, <cite>DAMN.</cite> It wasn’t an official single, but it has a music video, so I count it.
      </p>
      <div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NLZRYQMLDW4?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

      <p>
        The line that sums up the song for me is “This is my heritage, all I’m inheritin’,” as Lamar recounts his black experience, proud of being black (royalty!) but reminding listeners of the ever-present violence and hardships. There’s both good and bad, and Lamar isn’t denying or separating himself from any of it; he inherits all of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The song samples news reporter, Geraldo Rivera, who misinterpreted both Lamar’s lyrics and performance of “Alright,” infamously commenting that “hip hop has done more damage to young African-Americans than racism in recent years.” REALLY? I love how Lamar completely obliterates those who do not understand anything about hip hop with just 1:05 left in the song. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The audio counts down 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and <strong><em>BAM! BEAT SWITCH</em></strong>. One minute of pure, powerful uproar. Even with an explicit countdown warning you to be prepared, you are blown away by the intensity of Lamar’s spit.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h3><b>Number 2: “Sober Up” by AJR ft. Rivers Cuomo</b></h3>
      <div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J518lHntgow?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

      <p>
        Listen to that cello go. It’s actually artificial. <a href="https://twitter.com/AJRBrothers/status/910989691939360774">They scrapped the actual cellist.</a> Haha. The vocals aren’t amazing, but it adds to the raw sound they were going for.
      </p>
      <p>
        The song’s protagonist wants to return to the feeling of having a simple crush in elementary school. Fewer worries than today. The feeling of genuine life instead of the cold wall built from years of experiences. This year I felt existential numbness due to politics, work, relationships, and reaching my mid-twenties. *cringe* Listening to “Sober Up” brought me back to better days, simpler times, but more so helped me sober up and remember that I have friends, family, achievements, and goals to feel for. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Plus, the key change at 1:43 is sweeeeet. “My favorite color is you.” Whatever that means. ;P
      </p>
      <p>
        AJR’s entire album, <cite>The Click</cite>, is worth listening to if you enjoy the first song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZz1Gxdb_tA">“Overture”</a>, which mixes snippets of every song in the album into a chaotic, yet cohesive opening. Originally, I was going to put AJR lower on the list, but relistening to the album, I remembered how much I enjoy the combination of instruments and their hazy mix of pop, electronic, indie, and alternative all at once.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h3><b>Number 1: “1-800-273-8255” by Logic ft. Alessia Cara & Khalid</b></h3>
      <div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kb24RrHIbFk?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

      <p>
        Suicidal thoughts seem almost like a cruel requirement in growing up and in being a grown up. I think everyone has a thought about it at least a few times in life. If not, you are blessed, or privileged. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Suicide a sensitive topic that is <a href="http://www.learningfromlyrics.org/blink.html">tricky to discuss in music</a>. My mom and I listened to this song on the radio just about every day for a solid two months. One day, I guess she listened to the lyrics and, concerned, asked, “Is this song rated R?” She asks whenever anything seems “inappropriate.” I shook my head. If you stop listening the song after the first verse, you are missing out on some powerful lyrics and an important message to live.
      </p>
      <p>
        The POV switches from verse to verse are seamless. My favorite is the first verse which centers around feeling insignificant on Earth:<br><br>
        <cite>
          Ain't nobody callin' my phone<br>
          Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?<br>
          They say every life precious but nobody care about mine<br>
        </cite>
        <br>
        Absolutely got me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chorus is ridiculously catchy, and includes the slightest lyric alterations so that when you sing along, you don’t even realize you’ve gone from singing, “I don’t wanna be alive” to “I finally wanna be alive.” It happens so organically that you end up <em>feeling</em> what you’re singing. You have to do a rewind, like whoa, good job Logic, you got me.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are other songs that dive into the topic of suicide but the ones I know are from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRYZijLZR-Q">the perspective of an observer</a>, related the pain well but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3soskkvYBgM">didn’t give an alternative solution</a> (even though the song’s by an alternative rock band, bah dum chhhh), or downright <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL2ZwXj1tXM">didn’t make me feel better</a>. They’re great songs in their own right, but I absolutely commend “1-800-273-8255” for being so frank and empathetic. Now I’m thinking I should write an entire post highlighting songs about suicide. Why do I know so many? Hmm…
      </p>
      <p>
        <cite>Who can relate? (Woo!)</cite>
        <br>
        Such a catchy and colloquial way to say, “Hey, this may or may not be ‘normal’ to feel, but YOU ARE NOT ALONE.” Plus that “woo!” at the end is a quick way to express “You got that right!”
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the few problems I have with this song is that the title, the phone number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, is never mentioned in the song. Most people, including myself, just call it “the Logic song.” At least I know if I can’t Google the number due to the repeal of net neutrality, I can look to my Spotify playlist.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
      </p>
      <p>
        Extra fun fact: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4N0gZ0uXHw">Juanes</a> even wanted in on this song, so you know it’s legit. If you don’t know who Juanes is, allow me to sail you on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRt2sRyup6A">a beautiful journey</a>.
      </p>

      <hr>
      <p>
        Thanks for reading and tolerating my varied playlist of songs. There were many contenders that weren’t listed because they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWKQgpktIyg">weren't singles</a> or they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5j3bSprL1k">didn’t encapsulate 2017</a> for me.

        You know, searching through my Spotify saves and reviewing lists of hits over the year, I noticed most of the songs I listened to this year are actually from 2016… Therefore my opinion of 2017 music is basically null and void. But thanks for reading my opinions anyway! :D

        Signing off with a video from 2017 that I will never be able to unsee or disassociate from the #1 Billboard song of this year. Here’s to a 2018 full of gr8 music to appreci8, m8!
